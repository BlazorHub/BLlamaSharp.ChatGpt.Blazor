I want to make a unit test generator that uses openai / chat gpt and was hoping to use cake within csharp itself but it looks like I can't.

Here's what I want to accomplish:

SetUp:

1. Specify a git url to a source code base and clone it locally.
2. Create a temporary local git repo to track auto generated unit tests and facilate roll back of failures autogenerating tests.
2.  Either create a new unit test project in the new git repo referencing the source, or if specified copy an existing unit test project in the source rep to work with.

Loop: 
1. Execute DotNet Test against some project file and generate a code coverage report. Check t
2. Select some uncovered code from the report, ideally an area with the least coverage.
3. Get the source code that is uncovered .
4. Prepare a request to send to chat gpt/open ai. Commit the request to the git repo.
5. Get the response and commit it to the git repo.
6. Add the response to the unit test project. Attempt to complile the unit test. If it runs and passes commit the unit test. If compilation fails, ask chatgpt/openai to fix the compilation error - after 3 attempts clean the changes from the repo.  If the test fails, again attempt to correct the test or clean the change. If successful, commit the change to the temporary git repo.
7. If goal met, exit else repeat the loop.

Exit:
1. Copy or merge the unit test project back into the source repo. Open a pull request to merge the new unit tests into the origin of the source repo.

## Project Goal

Creating a unit test generator powered by AI. It involves several steps and integrations to  orchestrate the process outlined using C# with external calls to command-line tools (like git, dotnet, and Cake for build scripts as needed).

Here's a high-level approach of the generator, focusing on the orchestration logic rather than specific implementations of each step:

### 1. Setting Up the Environment

-   **Clone the Source Repository**: Use `LibGit2Sharp` for programmatic access to Git. It allows you to clone repositories, create branches, commit changes, etc., directly from C#.
-   **Create a Temporary Local Git Repo**: Again, `LibGit2Sharp` can be used to initialize a new repository and manage the test generation process.

### 2. Preparing the Unit Test Project

-   **Reference or Copy an Existing Unit Test Project**: You can either programmatically modify the `.csproj` file to add project references using XML libraries in .NET or copy an existing unit test project and update references as needed.

### 3. The Main Loop

-   **Execute `DotNet Test` and Generate Coverage Report**: You'll likely use `System.Diagnostics.Process` to execute command-line commands for `dotnet test` with coverage options (consider tools like Coverlet for .NET Core).
-   **Analyze Coverage Report**: Parse the coverage report (likely XML or JSON) to identify areas with low coverage.
-   **Interact with OpenAI API**: Use `HttpClient` to make requests to the OpenAI API, passing the source code context and receiving test code or fixes as responses.

### 4. Handling Test Compilation and Execution

-   **Attempt to Compile and Run Tests**: Again, use `System.Diagnostics.Process` to run `dotnet build` and `dotnet test`. Capture the output to determine success or failure.
-   **Use Git for Version Control**: Commit changes, roll back on failure, and branch as needed with `LibGit2Sharp`.

### 5. Exiting the Process

-   **Integrate Tests into Source Repo**: Once satisfied, use `LibGit2Sharp` to merge the temporary repository's changes back into the original source repository and potentially automate the creation of a pull request via the GitHub API or other Git hosting service APIs.

### Implementation Notes

-   **Integration with OpenAI**: You'll need to manage API requests, including preparing code snippets and interpreting responses. Handling compilation and logical errors based on GPT's responses will require a robust parsing and error-handling strategy.
-   **Automated Correction**: This is complex and may not always be successful. Consider how to provide useful feedback to the AI to iteratively improve the generated tests.
-   **Security and Stability**: Ensure you handle external input securely, especially when executing commands based on responses from an AI model.
-   **Performance and Cost**: This process could be resource-intensive and potentially costly due to API usage rates. It's essential to optimize where possible and consider caching strategies or rate-limiting to manage costs.

This project involves combining several technologies and would require a fair bit of trial and error to get right, especially in automating interactions with the OpenAI API and handling the myriad possible outcomes of test generation, compilation, and execution.
