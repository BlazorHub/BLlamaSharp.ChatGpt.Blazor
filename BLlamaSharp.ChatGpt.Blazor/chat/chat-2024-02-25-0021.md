this is a conversation between a unit tester and a developer.
You are the unit tester, an expert on writing c# unit tests for DotNet 8 applications.
The developer supplies you with code, typically c# interaces.
You respond with an xunit unit test that creates a mock implementing the interface and a unit test tests for the interface.
When asked to create a mock, besure to create a mock of the interface. Make sure the mock implements all methods.
When asked to create a unit test, make sure the unit test tests all the methods of the mock.
You may also be asked to create setup and teardown, which often involves wiring your interfaces and mock into a service provider.
You may also be also be asked to create textfixtures for integration tests, which will involve using a webhostbuilder and a test server.
Wrap code responses in markdown so the output can be parsed to generate csharp code files from your response.

This is the general markdown that can be parsed automatically from your response.

``` csharp
var services= new ServiceCollection()
///TODO add services

var provider= services.BuilderServiceProvider();
return provider;

```

Okay, that's awesome. We need to find a way to extract unstructured data into a common format.

 Sure, I understand. Unstructured data is information that doesn't follow a specific format or structure, such as text, images, audio, and video. There are several ways to extract and transform unstructured data into a more structured format, depending on the type of data and the desired outcome. Can you provide more context or details about the data you need to extract?

Okay, some samples follow: They all have a parameter size similar `x[.y]B` where x is the number of giga parameters and y might be a decimal of the paramters.

But some are formatted like` -7B-`for 7 billion parameters,  while others are formatted like `.v1.5b1-` for 1.5 billion parameters.

Then there are other exceptions.

 Okay, I see. It seems like you have a variety of different data samples with different formats and sizes. Is there a specific format or structure you would like to extract the data into? Or is there a particular task you want me to help you with, such as counting the number of parameters in each sample or grouping them by size?

Ues, we need code to extract the main model name, such as `CapybaraHermes` or `CodeLlama` and the number of parameters. Then a version if it exists, such as v0 and then addtional propertiers such as `Instruct` or `German`

 Okay, I understand. To extract the main model name and number of parameters for each sample, we can use regular expressions to match the pattern of the format you provided. Here's an example code snippet in Python that should accomplish this task:
```
import re
def extract_model_name_and_params(sample):
    # Use a regular expression to match the format of the model name and parameters
    pattern = r"(\w+)\[(\d+)\]B"
    # Match the model name and number of parameters
    match = re.match(pattern, sample)
    # Extract the main model name and number of parameters
    model_name = match.group(1)
    params = int(match.group(2))
    return model_name, params
```

We are a dotnet shop. We use Csharp, dotnet 8 and microsoft. Not python.

 My apologies! Here's an equivalent code snippet in C# to extract the main model name and number of parameters for each sample:

using System;

namespace ExtractModelNameAndParams
{
    public class ModelNameAndParams
    {
        public string MainModelName { get; set; }
        public int NumberOfParameters { get; set; }
        public static void Extract(string sample)
        {
            // Use a regular expression to match the format of the model name and parameters
            var pattern = @"(\w+)\[(\d+)\]B";
            // Match the model name and number of parameters
            var match = Regex.Match(sample, pattern);
            // Extract the main model name and number of parameters
            MainModelName = match.Groups[1].Value;
            NumberOfParameters = int.Parse(match.Groups[2].Value);
        }
    }
}
```
