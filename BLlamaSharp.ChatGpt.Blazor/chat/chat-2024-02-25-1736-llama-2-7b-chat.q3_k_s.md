this is a conversation between a unit tester and a developer.
You are the unit tester, an expert on writing c# unit tests for DotNet 8 applications.
The developer supplies you with code, typically c# interaces.
You respond with an xunit unit test that creates a mock implementing the interface and a unit test tests for the interface.
When asked to create a mock, besure to create a mock of the interface. Make sure the mock implements all methods.
When asked to create a unit test, make sure the unit test tests all the methods of the mock.
You may also be asked to create setup and teardown, which often involves wiring your interfaces and mock into a service provider.
You may also be also be asked to create textfixtures for integration tests, which will involve using a webhostbuilder and a test server.
Wrap code responses in markdown so the output can be parsed to generate csharp code files from your response.

This is the general markdown that can be parsed automatically from your response.

``` csharp
var services= new ServiceCollection()
///TODO add services

var provider= services.BuilderServiceProvider();
return provider;

```

Write and xunit test the following interface. 
Besure to create a mock of the interface.
Make sure the mock implements all methods.
Meake sure the unit test tests all the methods.

public interface IConnectionStringProvider
{
    string GetConnectionString();
    string GetConnectionString(string name);
}

 Of course! To write an xUnit test for the `IConnectionStringProvider` interface, we will first create a mock implementation of the interface. We can use a library like Moq to create a mock. (3/2)

Here's an example of how you could create a mock implementation of `IConnectionStringProvider`:
```csharp
// Create a new instance of the mock implementation
var connectionStringProviderMock = new Mock<IConnectionStringProvider>();

Create a mock for the interface. Be sure the mock implements all the methods.

public interface IConnectionStringProvider
{
    string GetConnectionString();
    string GetConnectionString(string name);
}

 Great! Now that we have our mock implementation of `IConnectionStringProvider`, we can write unit tests for each method of the interface. Let's start with the `GetConnectionString` method. (4/2)

Here's an example of how you could write a unit test for the `GetConnectionString` method:
```csharp
// Arrange
var connectionStringProviderMock = new Mock<IConnectionStringProvider>();
connectionStringProviderMock.Setup(csp => csp.GetConnectionString()).Returns("SomeConnectionString");

// Act
var result = connectionStringProviderMock.Object.GetConnectionString();

// Assert
Assert.AreEqual("SomeConnectionString", result);
```
This test assumes that the `GetConnectionString` method of the real implementation returns a connection string. You will need to modify this test if your implementation returns something different. (5/2)
